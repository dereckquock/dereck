import Counter from './counter';

😅 It took me forever, but I finally got around to making my personal website.

How embarrassing... 🤦‍♂️

## 🥞 Stack

It's 2019 and I decided to use Gatsby + MDX to build this thing because I love how Gatsby makes it easy to build fast
static sites. With the combination of MDX, it's super easy to write content 📝. I already write most things in Markdown,
so MDX made it simple and easy to work with. MDX also integrates seamlessly with React components! So you can import
React components right into your Markdown 🔥

<Counter />

Wow! That's a button rendered in Markdown 😮

It took a little bit of effort to set up MDX for blog posts, but [the Gatsby docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/mdx/)
are well-written and it's pretty straight forward if you follow everything step-by-step. If you follow the steps for
[programmatically creating pages](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/mdx/programmatically-creating-pages/), you can get a
blog up and running pretty quickly.

I'm using [prism-react-renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer) to syntax highlight code
snippets. [The MDX docs](https://mdxjs.com/guides/syntax-highlighting) give a good overview of how to integrate and
customize how code syntax highlighting works. For highlighting a specific line, you can use the `metastring` prop, which
is anything that comes after the language:

````md
```jsx metastring
<Component />
```
````

So something like this would highlight the first line:

````md
```jsx 1
<Component />
```
````

I used Gatsby to build our [wedding website](https://github.com/dereckquock/derteems) and it was so much fun to be able
to ship a lightning-fast app that's highly customizable. And because we were showing so many images, the built-in image
optimization and performance of [gatsby-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-image/) was a huge win.

This was a fun experience and I'm always learning 👨‍🎓 and I'm excited to continue to share stuff 🔥
