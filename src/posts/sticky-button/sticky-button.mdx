ðŸ›’ I'm on the Checkout web team at PayPal and we're working on the next generation of
our checkout experience. The review page can be fairly content-heavy if the
customer is eligible for the many features that we display on our single-page
app.

This is how a checkout review page looks for my account:

![Checkout review page](./long.png)

As you can see, there's a lot on the page. And this isn't even including other
features like currency conversion, applying for PayPal Credit, or if I have some
PayPal balance and want to apply that to the transaction.

The **Continue** button to continue checking out is all the way at the bottom. And
if the customer is checking out in a smaller viewport on their phone, they'd
have to scroll all the way down to continue. Adding any friction during a
checkout experience is asking for lower conversion. Enter `position: sticky`.

ðŸŽ‰ðŸ•¸

Not only is [sticky
positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#Sticky_positioning)
great for heading in a list, but it's the perfect use case for our **Continue** button.

<StickyButton />

Notice how the button stays stuck to the bottom until more content under it
pushes is up ðŸ”¥ and all we had to do was add some CSS:

```CSS
.sticky {
  position: sticky;
  bottom: 0;
}
```

Now the customer doesn't necessarily _need_ to scroll all the way down if they
want to check out quickly.
