Media queries are difficult to manage if you don't have a single place in your app where you have them defined. I've
worked in many apps where media queries are scattered throughout CSS and components and it's nearly impossible to
maintain.

I'm using [emotion](https://emotion.sh) and I was seeing how to implement media queries on this website. Super late to
the game, but I stumbled upon using [facepaint](https://github.com/emotion-js/facepaint) to define reusable media
queries.

Breakpoints are defined like:

```js
import facepaint from 'facepaint';

const mq = facepaint([
  '@media(min-width: 420px)',
  '@media(min-width: 920px)',
  '@media(min-width: 1120px)',
]);
```

This returns a function that you wrap around your object styles. üíÅ Remember, facepaint only works with object styles!

Then you can use `mq` to generate media queries for a specific property:

```js
mq({ color: ['red', 'green', 'blue'] });
```

generates this CSS üëá

```json
{
  "color": "red",
  "@media(min-width: 420px)": {
    "color": "green"
  },
  "@media(min-width: 920px)": {
    "color": "blue"
  }
}
```

Awesome!! üî• The array of colors map to the array of media query breakpoints that we passed into `facepaint`.

But what if we want to use `facepaint` with styled components? üßê

Just use template strings!

```js
const Block = styled.div`
  ${mq({ color: ['red', 'green', 'blue'] })}
`;
```

Now we can use our `<Block>` styled component with baked-in media queries and we don't have to redefine
`@media(min-width: 420px)` all over our app. üí• This is a massive win.

And we don't need to specify each breakpoint. We could have just used `mq({ color: ['red', 'green'] })` to only cover
the first breakpoint.

If you want to skip that first breakpoint and only cover the second one, you can use `mq({ color: ['red', null, 'green'] })` because `boolean`, `undefined`, and `null` values are ignored.

A lot of the time, we need to have [conditional styling based on component
props](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled#changing-based-on-props). This isn't too bad:

```js
const Block = styled.div((props) => {
  const { isReversed } = props;
  const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];

  return mq({
    backgroundColor: isReversed ? colors.reverse() : colors,
    width: ['100%', '70%', '50%'],
    height: '10vh',
    margin: 'auto',
    transition: 'all 0.3s ease',
  });
});

<Block isReversed={true} />;
```

Based on the `isReversed` prop, we can reverse the array of colors, or the values at each breakpoint that we previously
defined.

Defining breakpoints and reusing media queries across apps is a lot easier with `emotion` and `facepaint`. Our apps will
be easier to maintain and we can be consistent in how we support viewports of all sizes.
