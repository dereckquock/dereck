import BlinkingDot from './blinking-dot';

I needed to animate a red dot similar to how a recording light flashes. Kinda like this ðŸ‘‡

<BlinkingDot />

CSS Keyframes make it as easy as pie ðŸ¥§

```css
@keyframes blink {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  50% {
    opacity: 1;
  }
  100% {
    opacity: 0;
  }
}

.blinking-dot {
  width: 30px;
  height: 30px;
  background: rgba(179, 0, 0, 0.8);
  border-radius: 15px;
  animation: blink 1s infinite;
}
```

A blinking dot in React Native requires a little more work. Animations are usually implemented using
[react-native-reanimated](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated). With the help of
[react-native-redash](https://github.com/wcandillon/react-native-redash) from William Candillon, who does the [_Can it
be done in React Native_ videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/wcandill), animating this blinking dot isn't
that bad. Using the [loop() function](https://wcandillon.github.io/react-native-redash/run-animations#loop) with the
`boomerang` option set to `true`, the opacity will bounce back and forth from 0 to 1 ðŸ¦˜

```jsx
import Svg, { Circle } from 'react-native-svg';
import Animated, { Easing } from 'react-native-reanimated';
import { loop, mix } from 'react-native-redash';

const { set, useCode, Value } = Animated;

function BlinkingDot() {
  const animation = new Value(0);

  useCode(
    () =>
      set(
        animation,
        loop({
          duration: 1000,
          easing: Easing.inOut(Easing.ease),

          // the animation goes from 0 to 1 and then
          // from 1 to 0 in the next cycle
          boomerang: true,
          autoStart: true,
        })
      ),
    [animation]
  );

  // Interpolate the node from 0 to 1 without clamping
  const opacity = mix(animation, 0.1, 1);

  return (
    <Animated.View style={{ opacity }}>
      <Svg style={styles.circle} viewBox="0 0 100 100">
        <Circle cx="50" cy="50" r="50" fill={Colors.red} fillOpacity="1" />
      </Svg>
    </Animated.View>
  );
}
```

[React Native Reanimated](https://software-mansion.github.io/react-native-reanimated/index.html) uses a declarative API, so it's a lot
easier to understand what's going on. Animations are performed in steps, which is very similar to how keyframe
animations are executed. This is great because it lowers the barrier of entry for developers getting into React Native.

## UPDATE: Reanimated 2

With Reanimated 2, it's much simpler and composable out of the box. We can define the animated opacity by composing
together the higher-order animation functions `withTiming`, which returns the animation, and `withRepeat`, which takes
in the animation to repeat.

```jsx
import Svg, { Circle } from 'react-native-svg';
import Animated, {
  Easing,
  useAnimatedStyle,
  useSharedValue,
  withRepeat,
  withTiming,
} from 'react-native-reanimated';

function BlinkingDot() {
  const opacity = useSharedValue(0);

  // Set the opacity value to animate between 0 and 1
  opacity.value = withRepeat(
    withTiming(1, { duration: 1000, easing: Easing.ease }),
    -1,
    true
  );

  const style = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({ opacity: opacity.value }), []);

  return (
    <Animated.View style={style}>
      <Svg style={styles.circle} viewBox="0 0 100 100">
        <Circle cx="50" cy="50" r="50" fill={Colors.red} fillOpacity="1" />
      </Svg>
    </Animated.View>
  );
}
```
