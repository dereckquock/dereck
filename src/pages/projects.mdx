# üë®‚Äçüíª Projects

## Echo.Church

### üì± [Echo App](https://github.com/echo-labs-team/the-resonance-project)

App is built with React Native and allows people to be able to interact with the
Church.

#### Tech

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [Expo](https://expo.io/)
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)
- [react-native-reanimated](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated)
  & [react-native-redash](https://github.com/wcandillon/react-native-redash)
- [React Native Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/guides/guide-react-native/)

### üë• [Echo Groups](https://groups.echo.church/)

Web app enables people to discover and join small groups.

#### Tech

- React
- Redux
- [Reach UI](https://reacttraining.com/reach-ui/)

## Personal

### üíç [Wedding Website](https://github.com/dereckquock/derteems)

Wedding website built for mobile with Gatsby that showed wedding information,
displayed our engagement photos and allowed guests to RSVP.

#### Tech

- Gatsby
- [gatsby-source-google-sheets](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-google-sheets/)
  to use Google Sheets as a database for RSVP data
- [Reach UI](https://reacttraining.com/reach-ui/)
- [Netlify Forms](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/) for RSVP submissions

  Handling RSVP submissions was fairly difficult because of the variable amount
  of people that could RSVP for a certain group. For example, some of our
  friends are single and didn't have a plus-one and some of our family members
  had kids that were also attending.

  I had to fetch the people that were associated with the person that
  was RSVPing and based on the form input, I would reduce the data down into an
  object that tells me if a specific person was going to attend and their
  protein preference:

  ```javascript
  function getRsvpData(data) {
    return data.reduce((formData, { guest, isGoing, protein }) => {
      return {
        ...formData,
        [`${guest} Is Going`]: isGoing,
        [`${guest} Protein`]: protein,
      };
    }, {});
  }
  ```

  I wish that [Netlify Functions](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/)
  were available at the time because I would have definitely used that üòÖ

- [React Context]() for having a fun dark mode

  [Kent's post about how to use React Context
  effectively](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-use-react-context-effectively)
  really helped me execute this easily üî•

### üèà [NFL Stadiums VR blog](https://github.com/dereckquock/treydos)

React 360 VR blog that shows a more immersive experience of different NFL
stadiums that we've visited. We're utilizing our 360 camera and wanted to create
a React 360 tour app so others can get a feel for the different stadiums and
even plan to visit themselves. Our journey to visit all the stadiums is still a
work in progress and I'll rebuild this sometime soon.

#### Tech

- [React 360](https://facebook.github.io/react-360/)

## Hackathons

### üì± React Native app that enables automatic expense reporting

This was a hacked version of the PayPal app that allows a user to automatically
create an expense report from a transaction.

#### Tech

- React Native
- OCR using python (teammate built this) to parse an uploaded receipt
- [wit.ai](https://wit.ai/) for using NLP to categorize items on the receipt

### üßæ Invoicing app that uses image processing to prefill invoice data

App that used an item image to prefill the form used to create an invoice. After
filling out the invoice data, the seller is presented with different outputs for sending
an invoice: email the invoice, share an invoice link, scan a QR code, or share in
Facebook Messenger. This allowed the seller to create and send the invoice in
whatever specific context that they were in, creating less friction when selling
something.

#### Tech

- React
- [Google Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision) to process an item
  image
