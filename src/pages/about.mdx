I'm a software engineer from the Bay Area 🌉

I studied computer engineering at Cal Poly SLO and fell in love with web development after taking a software engineering
tech elect class. Although building robots are fun 🤖 I've always been passionate about crafting enjoyable user
experiences.

After I graduated, I started my journey at PayPal and became fascinated with the payments space and enabling commerce
all over the globe. Now I use web technologies to build exceptional experiences 👨‍💻

I focus mainly on React, React Native, Gatsby, GraphQL, Node, Express, and I'm expanding my TypeScript knowledge.
