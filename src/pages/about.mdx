I'm a software engineer from the Bay Area 🌉

I studied computer engineering at Cal Poly SLO and fell in love with web development after taking a software engineering
tech elect class. Although building robots are fun 🤖 I've always been passionate about crafting enjoyable user
experiences.

After I graduated, I started my journey at PayPal and became fascinated with the payments space and enabling commerce
all over the globe. Since my wife is in the healthcare space, I wanted to join her in trying to help better the lives of
others. Now I'm at [Alto Pharmacy on the Providers team](https://alto.com/blog/post/get-to-know-the-team-that-has-doctors-calling-alto) and it's been a blast 🚀

I focus mainly on React, React Native, GraphQL, and all things JavaScript & TypeScript.
